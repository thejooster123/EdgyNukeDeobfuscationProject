# EdgyBot Deobfuscation Project ðŸš€

### Now Fully Cracked!
<br>

## What is this? 
EdgyBot is a automatic program made by "gsrhackz", However the program is paid (and incredibly expensive at that!), so I've decided to take a crack at deobfuscating it and figuring out what this version (v.1.985) does, and how it works.

## How does this benefit me?
You don't have to pay 70 dollars for a program that didn't even bother to do a server side key check :crab:

## Currently Done...

Decompiling Code.. 40% <br>
Analysis of Code.. 50% <br>
Renaming Functions.. 30% <br>

### Any community help would be greatly appreciated, as i'm doing this for free, and decompiling an 8000+ line heavily obfuscated JS file isn't easy.

This repo currently contains the deobfuscated code, a minified version of it (so you can actually execute it with tampermonkey) and the original EdgyNuke script.
