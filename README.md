# EdgyBot Deobfuscation Project ðŸš€

## What is this? 
EdgyBot is a automatic program made by "gsrhackz", However the program is paid (and incredibly expensive at that!), so I've decided to take a crack at deobfuscating it and figuring out what this version (v.1.985) does, and how it works.

## "Well I'm gsrhackz, can you stop?"
If you want me to stop, sure I'll stop, but I want to see the source code to edgybot. I am not doing this because I want to undermine your hustle, I'm doing it because I wanna know how the program works, message me on github and we can work something out

## Currently Done...

Decompiling Code.. 20% <br>
Analysis of Code.. 10% <br>
Renaming Functions.. 5% <br>

### Any community help would be greatly appreciated, as i'm doing this for free, and decompiling an 8000+ line heavily obfuscated JS file isn't easy.

This repo currently contains the deobfuscated code, a minified version of it (so you can actually execute it with tampermonkey) and the original EdgyNuke script.
